Day-2 Task:
During this internship task, we explored the fundamental concepts of Angular, focusing on data binding, component interaction, and the Angular CLI. The session began with an introduction to data binding, covering both one-way and two-way data binding techniques to dynamically display and update data in the user interface. We then delved into the methods for passing information between parent and child components, utilizing both Input and Output decorators to enable seamless communication within the component hierarchy. Additionally, we learned to leverage the Angular CLI for various development tasks, including serving the application locally, generating new components, services, and other Angular constructs. This hands-on experience provided a comprehensive understanding of building and managing Angular applications, setting a strong foundation for advanced development practices.
